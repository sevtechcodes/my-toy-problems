// /Interview Cake Weekly Problem #514: 2nd Largest Item in a Binary Search Tree
// Time for this week's practice coding interview question!

// 2nd Largest Item in a Binary Search Tree

// Let's review last week's question, Bracket Validator:

// The trick was to use a stack.

// It might have been difficult to have that insight, because you might not use stacks that much.

// Two common uses for stacks are:
 
// parsing (like in this problem)
// tree or graph traversal (like depth-first traversal)

// So remember, if you're doing either of those things, try using a stack!

// If you liked last week's problem, pass it along with this handy pre-populated tweet. (And here's one for this week's.)
