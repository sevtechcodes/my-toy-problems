#O(log n) Time Complexity
Time complexity will have a running time that is proportional to the logarithm of the size of the input. 
This means, the running time of the algorithm will increase slowly as the size of the input increases. It is based on the logarithm of the size of the input, rather than the size itself.
This can be a significant advantage, especially for very large inputs. 

Here are a few examples of O(log n) algorithms:

Binary search algorithm: This repeatedly splits the list in half and compares the target element to the middle element until it finds the element or determines that it is not in the list. It is very efficient, especially for large lists. If you have a sorted list of n elements and you want to find a specific element, you can use the binary search algorithm to do so in O(log n) time.
